# SW Travel
A regular search form but made more fun by searching for different Star Wars planets (using the Star Wars API) and being able to "travel" to them.

## How to run
    npm install
    npm run start

## To do 
- [ ] Loading spinner
- [ ] Change background image depending on current planet
- [ ] Arrow key navigation (currently only accessible on keyboard through tabbing)
